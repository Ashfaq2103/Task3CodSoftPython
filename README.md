Task 3: Successfully completed Task 3 â€“ a Password Generator program.
The password generator tool I developed allows users to create strong,
random passwords based on their specified length and complexity.
This project has helped me sharpen my skills in Python programming,
particularly in areas like user input handling, randomization, and
string manipulation.
Key Features:
->Customizable password length
->Randomized mix of letters, numbers, and special characters
->Instant password display.
